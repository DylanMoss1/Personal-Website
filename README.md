# Personal-Website

**URL: https://dylan-moss.herokuapp.com/**

This was a website I built as a personal portfolio and a brief description about me as I've always wanted to build a website to showcase some of my projects that I have done. I also wanted to learn how to use React and build a full stack web application so this gave me a great opportunity to learn these skills.

## How it was made

This is website built using the MERN stack (React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB). Although most of the website's features could have been built with the front-end, I wanted to be able to recieve 'contact me' requests as well as store them in a database which I did using API calls from the front-end to the back-end and database. 

Another useful tool I used was Docker containers, learning how to effectively build and package my app automatically in a controlled Docker environment was really interesting and something I will definately try and use again in the future.

## What did I learn 

Most of these technologies such as React and Docker were new to me but I learnt a great deal about them when building this website.

I got a chance to focus on the UI of my website, many of my previous projects have been focussed primarily on the backend but using React allowed me to invest some time learning how to create an effective UI as well. I found this really enjoyable as I enjoy designing things and I felt like I was able to finally put into practice some of the skills I learnt during my Graphics Design GCSE. 

I also picked up some good software development habits such as utilising multiple git branches when working on different parts of the website development concurrently so that new additions to the back-end and front-end wouldn't interfere with each other until they were complete. 

I found out how to set up automatic push deployments from Github to Heroku and found this very interesting - I want to look deeper into how to implement CI/CD for my next website project.
