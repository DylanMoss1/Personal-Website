# Personal-Website

**URL: https://dylan-moss.herokuapp.com/**

This was a website I built as a personal portfolio and a brief description about me. I've always wanted to build a website to showcase some of my projects and I learnt many new skills such as React and full stack web development along the way. 

## How it was made

This is website built using the MERN stack (React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB). Although most of the website's features could have been built with the front end, I wanted to be able to recieve 'contact me' requests as well as store them in a database which led me to learning how to deploy full stack websites. 

Another useful thing I learnt was how to use Docker containers, learning how to effectively build and package my app automatically in a controlled Docker environment was really interesting and something I will definately try and use again in the future. 

Finally, I learnt how to set up automatic push deployments to Heroku from GitHub and want to look into implementing CI/CD for my next website project. 

## What did I learn 

Most of these technologies such as React and Docker were new to me but I learnt a great deal about them when building this website.

I also got a chance to focus on the UI of my website, many of my previous projects have been focussed primarily on the backend but using React allowed me to invest some time learning how to create an effective UI as well. I found this really enjoyable as I enjoy designing things and I felt like I was able to finally put into practice some of the skills I learnt during my Graphics Design GCSE.
